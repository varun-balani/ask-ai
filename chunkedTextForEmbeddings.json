Girvan and Newman’s divisive algorithm: •Shortest path betweenness is one example of an edge betweenness measure: the intuitive idea here  is that since there will only be a few inter-community edges, shortest paths between nodes that  belong to different communities will be constrained to pass through those few inter-community  edges.  •In random-walk betweenness, the choice of path connecting any two nodes is the result of random  walk instead of geodesic as in the case of shortest path.  •The current-flow betweenness definition is motivated by the circuit theory.  •First the network is virtually transformed into a resistance network where each edge is replaced by  a unit resistance and two nodes are chosen as unit current source and sink. •Then the betweenness of each edge is computed as the sum of absolute values of the currents  flowing on it with all possible selections of node pairs.",
